As professors, we have a lot of grad students we mentor. Weâ€™d like to help keep them on track, but we can never remember their project deadlines, or when our feedback to them is due. We needed an app that allows us to enter in all the important dates by category (i.e., student project deadline, feedback deadline, letter of recommendation deadline, etc.) and automatically remind us or the students before the deadline. Never miss an opportunity to mentor ever again!
